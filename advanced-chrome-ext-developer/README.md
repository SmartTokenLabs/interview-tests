# Test excersise for Advanced Javascript / Chrome ext Developer

The following exercise is to create a token gated Chrome Extension experience. The concept is that a game is loaded with a single view and the end user will unlock content as they progress.

## Part 1 - Create the Chrome Extension and set up working code example

- Download this example code https://github.com/nicktaras/basic-rpg (simple RPG game with 3 paths onload)
- Set up your working environment to help you serve / develop with this example
- Start to build a new chrome extension that is targeted towards this game.
- When the Chrome extension is switched on/off, the games graphics are adjusted (e.g. using CSS, invert the colour, addition of an asset to the canvas or page)
- Within the Chrome extension add 1-3 views to the RPG that can later be dispatched to the website (using the current graphics created)
- Within the Chrome extension add a secret that should not be learnt by the website e.g. "secret111"

## Part 2 - Wallet ownership through extension to create custom experience

- Create a web3 wallet connection inside the webpage (to learn the end users public address)
- Indicate the wallet is connected graphically inside the extension 
- Trigger a notification that the RPG game has now opened one of the 3 paths
- When the end user navigates to one of the paths it will now load a new view (injected from the extension data)
- Inside this second view, share a base64 version of the secret to the end user asking them to copy it
- When the end user navigates to either of the other two paths, the Chrome extension must trigger a prompt for the code.
- Entering the code will do simple check decoding the base64 and checking it matches.
- If the Proof matches the expected value then a notification will let them know they have completed the game. 

## Part 3 (fully optional - based on your time):

1 When the chrome extension is open, show itâ€™s up to date Rinkeby balance (or another balance of choice)
2 Further demonstrate features available with Chrome extensions (alarms, storage, history, security)
